## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Senior Lecturer in **Digital Design in Civil Engineering (Education & Research)**, specializing in **geotechnical earthquake engineering** and **computational structural mechanics**. His research focuses on seismic soil-structure interaction (SSI) and Structure-Soil-Structure Interaction (SSSI).
I am actively exploring applications of Virtual Reality and Virtual Construction Design in civil engineering, focusing on developing software and tools tailored to industry needs. âš¡  _I also offer consultancy services in code implementation, computational modelling (FEM), and seismic soil-structure interaction (SSI) analysis_

 ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:
     + dynamic simulation and design of wind turbines
     + seismic soil-structure interaction
     + nonlinear modelling of cyclic soil degradation
     + ground motion modelling in urban areas
     + reliability analysis and statistics in geotechnical earthquake engineering

 ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
   + USRA - Uncertainty Site Response Analysis - MATLAB/PYTHON software for simulating site response analysis under uncertain conditions of soil and ground motion.
   + POSSREL - Data-Driven Possibility Reliability Assessment (MATLAB/PYTHON)
   + WIM - Wind Information Modelling (Unreal Engine and REVIT)
   + SPILE: An Open-Source Code for the Seismic Offshore Soil-Structure Interaction for Next-Generation Wind Energy Infrastructures (Python)
